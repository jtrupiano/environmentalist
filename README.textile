h1. environmentalist

* http://github.com/jtrupiano/environmentalist/tree/master

h2. DESCRIPTION

Provides an executable that converts a rails app's config structure.  The basic idea is that environments themselves are now first-class citizens, allowing you to create several environments (e.g. staging, prodtest, demo, etc.) in a clean, organized fashion.  Each environment is given its own folder where it can store its own set of configuration files (think mongrel configs, apache configs, etc.) without polluting the top-leve config/ directory.

h2. REQUIREMENTS

* none, but it's really only useful with a rails app

h2. INSTALL

  sudo gem install environmentalist

h2. USAGE

This gem is intended to be a "one-time consumption."  You use it once to alter/convert the structure of your rails app (works best with a newly-generated app).  It should <b>not</b> be included as a gem dependency for your project.

  environmentalize /path/to/rails/root
