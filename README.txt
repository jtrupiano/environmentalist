= environmentalist

* http://github.com/jtrupiano/environmentalist/tree/master

== DESCRIPTION:
Provides an executable that converts a rails app's config structure.  The basic idea is that environments themselves are now first-class citizens, allowing you to create several environments (e.g. staging, prodtest, demo, etc.) in a clean, organized fashion.  Each environment is given its own folder where it can store its own set of configuration files (think mongrel configs, apache configs, etc.) without polluting the top-leve config/ directory.

== SYNOPSIS:

  FIX (code sample of usage)

== REQUIREMENTS:

* none, but it's really only useful with a rails app

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install environmentalist
