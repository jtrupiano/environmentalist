=== v0.2.1
2009-03-06

* Add automatic gem install + activation (bug fix for GemInstaller pending) added to preinitializer.rb

=== v0.2.0
2009-03-02

* Added preinitializer.rb to the set of the generated files for you.  It auto-loads gem dependencies as specified in geminstaller.yml files that can be distributed across your environment directories.
* Moved gem onto jeweler (with the temporary loss of rubyforge support --- rubyforge integration has been achieved in a fork of the jeweler repo, so we should have it back once it's merged back into the main line.)

=== v0.1.0
2008-08-04

* Initial Release: environmentalize executable will make environments first-class citizens in your rails app!
